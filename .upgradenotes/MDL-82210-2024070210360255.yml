        Upon upgrading Font Awesome from version 4 to 6, the solid family was
        selected by default.


        Support for the `regular`, and `brands` families of icons has now been adde,
        allowing icons defined with `icon_system::FONTAWESOME` to use them.


        Icons can select the FontAwesome family (`fa-regular`, `fa-brands`, `fa-solid`)
        by using the relevant class name when display the icon.
